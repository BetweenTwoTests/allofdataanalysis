# About {-}

This is a reproduction of my study notes & exercises from various points of my academic and professional career in statistics. Please excuse the grandiose title. (Fans of statistics should note that the title is tongue-in-cheek reference to [this equally grandiose book title](https://www.google.com/search?q=all+of+statistics&oq=all+of+statistics) )
