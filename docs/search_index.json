Hypothesis is a positive statement of a question. Error is assumed to be present Science proves in negative direction. Our understanding of the world changes / improves by showing that the existing scientific “fact” is false and other alternative hypotheses are better candidates to explain the observed events. Let’s call this currently accepted hypothesis as null hypothesis. Saying that there are many other alternative hypothesis that could be shown true by data is kind of unfair to the null hypothesis and also difficult to reason about. What if state our null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis in a way that it is a choice between one or the other? i.e. either null or alternative hypothesis is a better explanation of the observed data. This is how Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) questions are commonly formulated. Actually, let’s define 3 types of hypothesis Research Hypothesis asdf Research Hypothesis asdf Formulating the hypothesis "],
